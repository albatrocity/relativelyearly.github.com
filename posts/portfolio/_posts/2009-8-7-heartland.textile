"Heartland Community Church":http://heartlandchurch.org wanted a way to share and showcase their "missions activity":http://heartlandmissions.org with both their members and the rest of the world. Relatively Early worked with Heartland to develop an entire content management system for missions-based activity, including videos, calendar events, and image galleries. 

In addition, a user-driven missionary activity showcase ("Who's Where":http://heartlandmissions.org/locations) was developed to highlight members' mission activities: past, present, and future.
